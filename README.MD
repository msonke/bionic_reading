# Bionic Reading

Bionic Reading is a phenominon that reveals that by bolding the first few letters of each word, the speed and efficiency is greatly improved.

This is a simple javascript library designed to be inserted into blog apps that will automatically bold the first few letters of each word.

Ideally this would be used for blogs, but can also be used for any other use case, obviously.

**WIP**
